// FUNCTIONAL TEST - CART CHECKOUT
const checkout = (customer) => {

}










// A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:

// What should happen if the cart is empty?
// What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
// What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
// Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!
